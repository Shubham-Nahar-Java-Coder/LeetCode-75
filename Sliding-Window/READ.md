## About Sliding Window:

- Sliding window is a technique used for solving problems that involve finding a **substring, subarray, or a subsequence** that satisfies certain conditions. 

- The sliding window approach typically involves maintaining a window of elements within an array or a string and sliding this window one element at a time to find the desired solution efficiently.

- In **Layman's Terms**: Think of it like looking through a window that you can move along a row of numbers. Each time you move the window, you're checking a different group of numbers to see if they contain something you're interested in. And as you move along, you remember the most interesting thing you've found so far.
