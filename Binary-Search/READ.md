## Notes:

I've prepared some notes on Binary Search. It's beneficial to review them before diving into the problem statements and solutions. This understanding will facilitate easier issue resolution and clearer comprehension.

## Binary Search:
- Binary search is an **efficient** algorithm used to **find** a specific target value within a **sorted array or list**. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### Important:
- Binary search is incredibly efficient, especially with large datasets, as it halves the search space with each iteration. 
- **Its time complexity is O(log n).**
- binary search only works on sorted arrays.
