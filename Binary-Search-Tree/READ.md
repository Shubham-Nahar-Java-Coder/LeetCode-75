# LeetCode-75

This repository contains Binary Search Tree problems categorized into two levels: Easy and Medium.

## Easy: 
1. Search in a Binary Search Tree

## Medium: 
1. Delete Node in a BST

## Notes:

I've prepared some notes on Binary Search Tree. It's beneficial to review them before diving into the problem statements and solutions. This understanding will facilitate easier issue resolution and clearer comprehension.

## Binary Search Tree:
- A binary search tree (BST) is a **binary tree data structure** where each node has **at most two children**, referred to as the left child and the right child. 

### Important:
1. All nodes in the **left subtree** have values **less than the node's value**.
2. All nodes in the **right subtree** have values **greater than the node's value**.
    
## Successor & Predecessor:

- Successor: Finding the node with the next largest key value.
- Predecessor: Finding the node with the next smallest key value.
