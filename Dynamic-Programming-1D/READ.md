## Notes:

I've prepared some notes on Dynamic Programming 1D. It's beneficial to review them before diving into the problem statements and solutions. This understanding will facilitate easier issue resolution and clearer comprehension.

## Dynamic Programming:
- Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique used to solve problems by **breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem** just once. It **stores the results of subproblems in memory** so that they can be **reused later.**

### Dynamic Programming can be classified into two types:

### Memoization (Top-Down):

- In this approach, the problem is solved recursively by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.
- However, the results of these subproblems are stored in memory usually in an array or hash map so that they don't need to be recalculated every time they are encountered.

### Tabulation (Bottom-up):

- In this approach, the problem is solved iteratively by starting with the simplest subproblems and building up to the desired solution.
- The results of subproblems are stored in a table (usually a 1D or 2D array) and are used to calculate larger subproblems until the final solution is reached.
